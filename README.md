# Realtime-Object-Recognition
A straightforward Python project for performing real time object detection in images using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module.

It leverages a pre-trained model to identify various objects within an image. The script highlights detections with colored bounding boxes and displays the object's name with its confidence score. Built for flexibility, it is made for processing static images only.
